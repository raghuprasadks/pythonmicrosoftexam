#In Python, anonymous function is a function that is defined 
#without a name.
#While normal functions are defined using the
# def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined 
# using the lambda keyword.
#Hence, anonymous functions are
# also called lambda functions.
#syntax
# lambda arguments: expression
#Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but 
#only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. 
#Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are 
#required.
#Even numbers
